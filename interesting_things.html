		<h3>Interesting things learned in this project:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Using a large quantity of data and putting it into a VR environment especially such as the CAVE2 can be a challenging task. This is even more prominent when there are minute details that cannot be missed in order to increase the appeal of the application.</li>
			<li>There are a higher number of red and yellow stars in space compared to blue stars. This is due to the color being an indicator of the age/life of the star.</li>
			<li>When dealing with large applications in virtual environments, optimizing the performance of the application is very, if not the most important aspect. Neglecting optimizations can be the difference between the application being useable or not.</li>
			<li>Familiarity with development environments can highly boost the productivity when making projects.</li>
			
		</ol>
