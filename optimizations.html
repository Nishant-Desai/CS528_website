		<h2>Optimizations</h2>
		<h3 style="color: brown">By Nishant Desai</h3>

		<h3>Some optimizations that help:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>It was important to ensure that the material and prefabs I used for the stars and constellation lines were not too resource intensive to affect the frame rate drastically.</li>
			<li>Using InvokeRepeating instead of update function was also very helpful in increasing performance.</li>
			<li>For gameobjects such as the stars, there is no need for the prefab to have shadows. Therfore they can be disabled to save computational load.</li>
			<li>Since the dataset has entries for stars that are farther than what users can see from a standpoint, it is useful to have the application render the stars that are within a certain range of the user at a given point in time.</li>
