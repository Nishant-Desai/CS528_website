		<p>This application allows you to explore the stars and travel as far as you would like to! Feel free to check the beautiful stars around us with their vibrant colors. These colors have an actual purpose to them as they have been taken from the real data of each star. The colors are hence accurate and it can be observed based on the fact that there are in general very few blue stars around us that can be seen. The majority of stars near us are some shade of red or yellow.</p><img src="./docs/assets/images/CS528_project_startside" alt="starting panel">

		<p>You can also see the numerous constellations that humans have come up with over the years, connecting the stars. Currently you get the option of choosing between 5 different sets of constellation: Modern, Egyptian, Aztec, Romanian and Indian. Each set has many constellations as recorded by the respective culture. From the menu you can bring up additional information about the constellation Orion. It gives some background on the constellation and is a good read.</p>
		<br>
		<p>There is an option to see the exo planet data where the stars switch from their spectral color types to a color scheme based on their number of known planets. Further, users can select the teleport button to go back to their original position from which they started. This is useful as the center position is the best suited for seeing everything around.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Users can experience the change in position of the stars by clicking the change time button. This shows all the stars moving in their corresponding direction with different speeds over time. A display is present on the screen that indicates the time that has passed. Upon stopping the functionality, the stars return to their normal position.</p>
